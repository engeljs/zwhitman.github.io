              <h2 class="featurette-heading">So what's the idea?<span class="muted">| why should I care</span></h2>
            <p>Through the ubiquity of smartphones, an enormous quantity of geolocation data is available in the United States, in many cases, as a result of users installing 3rd-party mobile applications. A recent report from <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9245438/Evan_Schuman_Starbucks_caught_storing_mobile_passwords_in_clear_text_?taxonomyId=17&pageNumber=1">Computer World</a> stated that the Starbucks mobile payment application "...displays an extensive list of geolocation tracking points." But so what? What is the value of these data?  How could Starbucks use these data to better target me as a customer or improve their services?  
</p>

<p>
I decided to find out for them. In this experiment, I attempt to profile myself using only my location data as recorded by my smartphone. I will then use these data from the perspective of Starbucks to figure out how they could get me into their shops.
</p>

<p>
For this experiment, I needed personal location data, but I don't have the Starbuck's mobile payment application on my phone. So, I collected 90 days of data from <a href="http://www.google.com/locationhistory">Google's Location History website</a>, a treasure trove of personal geolocation tracking points. 
</p>

<p>
After collecting these data, I thought Starbucks would first want to profile me as a customer so I tried to identify a few basics from my locations: where do I live, where do I work, and how much money do I probably make. I then wanted to identify my coffee purchasing habits, determining the cafes I normally frequent, the time I usually spend per visit, and how much am I likely spending. Finally, I wanted to figure out why I wasn't going to Starbucks, and identify what Starbucks could do to attract my business. Remember, I'm only relying on the location data collected from my smartphone for all of these analyses. 
</p>

<p>
As a disclaimer before moving into the findings, I've kept most of my results fairly generalized to avoid disclosing personal information (excluding where I drink coffee).

<p>To figure out where I work, I isoloated my locations during normal business hours (excluding holidays). From this, it was clear that during the working day I can be found in one of these 3 very distinctive areas. The northern-most point is a residential area that has several service-orientated sectors nearby. The eastern-most area is located directly on a Federal Department building, while the western-most area centers on a building in Rosslyn Virginia which is occupied by Deloitte LLP and CEB advisory. Also, I make semi-regular trips between the Federal Department building and Deloitte/CEB during the day so it's likely that I work for Deloitte LLP or CEB Advisory and support the Department. From these results it also appears as though I may telework on occasion.

                <p>Using publicly available real estate resources, I quickly looked up the average cost of apartments in the building where I reside. The mean cost is $568,800, with 95% confidence that the value of the apartment is somewhere between $526,746 and $610,819. Assuming general industry guidelines to estimate expenses, I or the owner probably bought the property with a down payment of 10%, and an interest rate of 4.2%, which gives us a monthly cost that likely falls between 30% and 50% of total household income. These estimates place the monthly cost of ownership between $3,108 and $3,745, and as a result, it's likely that my household brings in between $74,592 and $149,800. I could further refine these numbers if I used the square footage I estimated from the map data, which incidentally was 90% accurate.</p>

Well it looks like during the weekends. The location data show that I tend to stay near home for the most part, frequenting a few nearby coffee shops, one diner, and a whisky specialty bar in descending regularity. I threw that last detail in because if Starbucks wanted to get into whisky, I would be supportive. When I leave the neighborhood, I evidently spend some time in Georgetown and the National Mall, usually stopping off at coffee shops once per outing.</p>

Why is that? A quick review of the independent coffee shop's website tells us that it is comperably priced and actually doesn't offer wifi during the weekend. The only distinguishing features of the independent coffee shop is that it has a more extensive menu and serves alcohol. </p>

                <p>Thirty percent of time, I stop in and leave immediately. But in most cases, I stay at the independent coffee shop for more than 30 minutes. Assuming the duration of my stay is correlated with the number of purchases made (including meals), we can assume that I have a relatively high average amount of money spent per visit. </p>
<p>
If we make a few inferences, we can estimate the total amount of money spent by me, as well as my average per visit. Let's assume that during the times when I simply enter and leave the coffee shop, I am purchasing a single coffee at a cost of $2.50. Let's also assume that for visits where I stay, I buy at least 1 coffee per hour, with a maximum number of 3 coffees per day. Additionally, for visits lasting between 1 and 10 hours (yes, I stayed that long once), let's assume I have purchased one meal every 6 hours at a value of $15 dollars as estimated from the online menu. With these basic assumptions, we can therefore infer that the total amount spent by me has been $132.50 over a period of 3 months, or $6.63 per visit.

                <p>Why do I prefer Starbucks' competitors? Is it because I do not like to patronize national brand coffee chains? No, it's not - the map data proves that this isn't the case. Zooming out and looking at what other coffee shops I prefer when I leave my neighborhood, we find that I frequent the coffee shop and bakery chain "Paul". What's more, all of these Paul locations have at least 1 Starbucks located on the same block. Therefore, we can conclude that I will accept purchasing coffee from a national chain.</p>
                <p>The data also show that neither cost nor available wifi are important factors when I decide to choose a coffee shop. Both Paul and the independent shop have comparable, if not more expensive pricing, and no free wifi when I am visiting. Location isn't a factor either. The independent shop is farther away from my house than Starbucks, and the Paul locations are nowhere near my home or workplaces.</p>

                <h2>So what can we do about it?</h2>
              </hgroup>
            <div class="mask2"> <a href="img/map_images/move.png" rel="prettyPhoto"><img src="img/map_images/move.png" alt=""></a> </div>
               <div> <a class="more-link" href="img/map_images/move.png">view map</a> </div>
              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>From location data alone, we now know that I will choose the competitors every time when given the chance. I will walk longer distances for higher prices and no complimentary wifi. We know that I go early, and stay for relatively long periods of time on the weekends, and do not visit coffee shops in general during the week.</p>

<p>
So what makes the competitors that much more attractive? When comparing Paul and Starbucks, the clear differentiation is the type of food provided. Paul is known as a French patisserie that bakes on site. Looking at the independent coffee shop's menu, it appears they also serve freshly made French pastries. Perhaps to attract me, Starbucks should improve the quality of their croissants.
</p>

<p>
But aside from revamping their food line, what are some small actions that Starbucks could take tomorrow that might nudge me into their shops? It's clear that on weekends, I go to a coffee shop early in the mornings and often stay for the entire day. Knowing this is my pattern of behavior, perhaps Starbucks should consider advertising to me 20 minutes before I usually arrive at the coffee shop. While the data show that price may not be the biggest factor for me in choosing a coffee shop, a coupon for a free coffee and croissant might tempt me into the shop. Judging from the data, this would most likely result in me staying for several hours, if not all day, and spending upwards of $30. Starbucks could target those who spend the most time in their shop, and reward them for their loyalty. </p>
<p>
From just my location data, it is clear that much can be learned about an individual using only their location, and it stands to reason that companies should encourage the use of their smartphone applications as a means to gather location data. While I do not have Starbucks' application installed on my phone, those who do should be rewarded, and those who do not should be encouraged. I would argue that the location data is enough to justify that Starbucks should offer gift-card holders more value if they redeem their purchases using the application rather than simply using the card. The information gathered would allow Starbucks to profile that customer, and as a result, offer more targeted services.  
</p>
<p>
Location data can do many things, and this "experiment" is only scratching the surface. Location data can help identify where stores should or shouldn't be located based on real or even real-time customer traffic; geo-fencing can enable promotions or coupons to appear on a customer's smartphone as they are approaching a shop; and a customer's location can determine their level of social influence which would help identify the most effective advocates for the brand. Also, other data types can be used in concert with location to identify patterns in customer behavior: how does your customer base interact with your services during inclement weather? 
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the point of this experiment is to demonstrate the fact that location data is a very powerful asset in profiling and targeting customers, and companies such as Starbucks have a tremendous wealth of opportunity that needs to explored.</p>
