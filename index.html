              <h2 class="featurette-heading">So what's the idea?<span class="muted">| why should I care</span></h2>
            <p>Through the ubiquity of smartphones, an enormous quantity of geolocation data is available in the United States, in many cases, as a result of users installing 3rd-party mobile applications. A recent report from <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9245438/Evan_Schuman_Starbucks_caught_storing_mobile_passwords_in_clear_text_?taxonomyId=17&pageNumber=1">Computer World</a> stated that the Starbucks mobile payment application "...displays an extensive list of geolocation tracking points." But so what? What could Starbucks do with my location? How could they use these data to better target me as a customer?  
</p>

<p>
So I decided to find out for them. In this experiment, I attempt to profile myself using only my location data as recorded by my smartphone. I will then use these data from the perspective of Starbucks to figure out how they could get me into their store.
</p>

<p>
For this experiment, I needed personal location data, but I don't have Starbuck's mobile payment application on my phone. So, I collected 90 days of data from <a href="http://www.google.com/locationhistory">Google's Location History website</a>, a veritable treasure trove of "geolocation tracking points". 
</p>

<p>
After collecting these data, I first wanted to profile myself so I started with the basics: where do I work, where do I sleep, and how much money do I probably make. I then wanted to identify my coffee purchasing habits, determining the cafes I normally frequent, the time I usually spend per visit, and how much am I likely spending. Finally, I wanted to figure out why I wasn't going to Starbucks, and identify what Starbucks could do to attract my business. 
</p>

<p>
As a disclaimer before moving into the findings, I've kept most of my results as generalized as possible to avoid disclosing personal information (excluding where I drink coffee).

<p>To figure out where I work, I isoloated my locations during normal business hours (excluding holidays). From this, it was clear that during the working day I can be found in one of these 3 very distinctive areas. The northern-most point is a residential area that has several service-orientated sectors nearby. The eastern-most area is located directly on a governmental department building, while the western-most area centers on a building in Rosslyn Virginia which is occupied by Deloitte LLP and CEB advisory. Also, I make semi-regular trips between the governmental department building and the Deloitte/CEB building during the day so it's likely that this character works for a consulting firm that supports a federal department. From these results it also appears as though I may telework on occasion.

                <p>Using publicly available real estate resources, I quickly looked up the average cost of apartments in the building where I reside. The mean cost of apartments is $568,800, with 95% confidence that the value of the apartment is somewhere between $526,746 and $610,819. Assuming general industry guidelines, I probably bought the property with a down payment of 10%, an interest rate of 4.2%, and monthly costs that fall between 30% and 50% of my total household income. These estimates place the monthly cost of ownership between $3,108 and $3,745, and as a result, it's likely that my household brings in between $74,592 and $149,800. I could further refine these numbers if I used the square footage I estimated from the map data, which incidentally was 90% accurate.</p>

I threw that last detail in because if Starbucks wanted to get into whisky, I would be supportive. When I leave the neighborhood, I evidently spend some time in Georgetown and the mall, usually stopping off at coffee shops for a change of pace.</p>

The 2 distinguishing features of the independent coffee shop is that it has a more extensive menu and serves alcohol. </p>

                <p>Thirty percent of time, I stop in and leave immediately. But in most cases, I stay at the competitor coffee shop for more than 30 minutes. Assuming the duration of their stay is correlated with the number of purchases made (including meals), we can assume that I have a relatively high average amount of money spent per visit. If we make some basic inferences, we can estimate the total amount of money spent by me, as well as my average money spent per vist.</p>
<p>
Let's assume that during the times when I simply enter and leave the coffee shop, I am simply purchasing a single coffee at a cost of $2.50. Let's also assume that for visits longer than that, I buy at least 1 coffee per hour, with a maximum number of 3 coffees per day. Additionally, for visits lasting between 1 and 10 hours, let's assume I have purchased one meal every 6 hours at a value of $15 dollars. With these basic assumptions, we can therefore infer that the total amount spent by this individual has been $132.50 over a period of 3 months, or $6.63 per visit.

                <p>Why do I prefer to go to the Starbucks' competitor? One possible explanation is that I do not like to patronize national brand coffee chains. Unfortunately, the map data suggests that this probably isn't the case. Zooming out and looking at what other coffee shops I prefer, we find that the I often frequent the coffee shop and bakery chain "Paul". All of the Paul locations that I have visited had at least 1 Starbucks located on the same block, and therefore we can assume from the data that generally, I will accept purchasing coffee from a national chain.</p>

                <p>From location data alone, we now know that I will choose the competitors every time given the chance. They will walk longer distances for similar prices and no complimentary wifi. We know I stay for relatively long periods of time on the weekends, and does not visit coffee shops during the week.</p>
<p>
So what makes the competitors that much more attractive? When comparing Paul and Starbucks, the clear differentiation is the type of food provided. Paul is known as a high-end French patisserie that bakes on site. Looking at the independent coffee shop's menu, it appears they also serve freshly made croissants. Perhaps to attract me, Starbucks should consider improving the quality of their french pastries.
</p>
<p>
I also appear to spend a significant amount of time at the coffee shop, potentially reading or working. Therefore, perhaps the ambiance is an important factor, and perhaps comparing the interiors of the competitors would be valuable.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the point of this experiment is to demonstrate the fact that location data can be a very powerful asset in profiling and targeting customers.</p>

1. Offer gift-card holders more value if they redeem it on their phone to collect location data.<br>
2. Mix together unstructured data (location) with structured data (data collected by app).<br>
3. Gathering dwell time. <br>
4. Identify advocates - so people who are always there might be more vocal or social influencers.<br>
5. Pre-empt advertising that's personal. Push notifications (we know they like croissants so send them discounts)<br>
6. Figure out where they need to locate.<br>
7. Weather data.<br>
8. Time sensitivity.<br>
